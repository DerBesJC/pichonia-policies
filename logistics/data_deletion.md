# Data Deletion – Logistics
_Last updated: 2025-11-03_

## 1. Scope
This policy explains how users of the Pichonia logistics app (“Dropt”) can request deletion of their personal data and what data we may retain to meet legal, security, and operational requirements.

## 2. Who May Request Deletion
- **Customers, Truck Owners, and Drivers** with verified accounts.
- Authorized representatives may submit on a user’s behalf where legally permitted.

## 3. What We Delete
Upon a verified request, we delete or irreversibly de-identify:
- **Account data:** name, email/phone, profile, settings.
- **App telemetry:** non-essential logs tied to your account.
- **In-app media/content** you provided (e.g., truck photos) unless needed for open disputes, fraud review, or law enforcement requests.

## 4. What We May Retain (Required)
We may retain limited data where required or allowed by law and platform safety:
- **Payments/Tax/Audit records** (up to **7 years**) to satisfy bookkeeping, chargeback, and anti-fraud obligations.
- **Transaction artifacts** (e.g., job IDs, pickup/dropoff timestamps, invoices) needed for legal claims, safety, or audits.
- **Security logs** (typically **90–180 days**) for abuse and fraud prevention.
- **Backups**: data may persist in encrypted backups for up to **30–90 days** after deletion before rolling out.

## 5. Third-Party Processors Involved
We will forward or instruct deletion where applicable for integrated services used by Dropt, including (as enabled in your deployment):
- **Stripe** (payments), **Firebase** (Auth/FCM/Crashlytics/Firestore), **Google Maps Platform** (geolocation/places).  
Processor-specific retention policies may apply; we request deletion of linked records where feasible.

## 6. Identity Verification
We must verify you before processing:
- **In-app**: use the account email/phone already on file (OTP or signed-in request).
- **Email**: write from your registered email to **info@pichonia.com** with subject **“Data Deletion – Logistics”**.
- We may ask for limited additional information (e.g., last 4 of phone, recent job ID) solely to confirm identity.

## 7. How to Submit a Request
- **In-App:** Settings → Privacy → **Request Data Deletion**  
- **Email:** **info@pichonia.com** (subject: “Data Deletion – Logistics”)  
Include your **full name**, **account email/phone**, and optional **reason**.

## 8. Response & Timelines
- We acknowledge within **7 days** and complete verified requests within **30 days** (or notify if an extension is needed).
- If we cannot delete certain items (see §4), we will explain why and what is retained.

## 9. Effects of Deletion
- Deletion is **account-ending**: you lose access to history, ratings, saved vehicles, and active jobs.
- Some anonymized operational stats may persist (e.g., aggregate region utilization).

## 10. Appeals & Questions
If you believe your request was denied in error, reply to our decision email or contact **info@pichonia.com**. We’ll re-review and provide a written outcome.
