# Responsible Disclosure – Logistics
_Last updated: 2025-11-04_

## 1. Purpose
We value the security of our users and systems. This policy explains how security researchers can report vulnerabilities to Pichonia responsibly.

## 2. Scope
Report vulnerabilities affecting the logistics app, APIs, mobile builds, or infrastructure that Pichonia controls. Out-of-scope services (e.g., third-party SDKs) may be forwarded where applicable.

## 3. How to Report
- Email: **security@pichonia.com** (preferred) or **info@pichonia.com**
- Include details to reproduce: affected endpoints, request/response samples, screenshots, PoC code.
- Do not publicly disclose until we confirm remediation or provide written permission.

## 4. Research Guidelines
- No data destruction, exfiltration, or service disruption.
- Only access accounts/data you own or have explicit permission to use for testing.
- Rate-limit your testing to avoid degrading service for others.

## 5. Our Commitment
- Acknowledge reports within **72 hours**.
- Provide a status update at meaningful milestones.
- Remediate with priority proportional to severity.
- Credit (with permission) in release notes or a Hall of Thanks.

## 6. Safe Harbor
If you follow this policy in good faith, we will not initiate legal action for your security research.

## 7. Out of Scope (Non-qualifying)
- Social engineering, physical attacks, or DDoS.
- SPF/DMARC/DKIM suggestions, clickjacking on non-sensitive pages.
- Missing best-practice headers without demonstrable impact.
- Vulnerabilities requiring rooted/jailbroken devices without practical risk.
