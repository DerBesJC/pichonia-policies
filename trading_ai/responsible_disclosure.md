_Last updated: 2025-11-04_

## 1. Purpose
We welcome responsible security research and coordinated disclosure for the Trading AI product and services.

## 2. Scope
Report vulnerabilities affecting the Trading AI web app, APIs, model endpoints, or infrastructure owned by Pichonia. Third-party data providers/brokers may be out of scope but we will coordinate when possible.

## 3. How to Report
- Email: **security@pichonia.com** or **info@pichonia.com**
- Provide clear reproduction steps, endpoints, sample payloads, logs, and screenshots.
- Please keep findings confidential until remediation or explicit permission.

## 4. Research Guidelines
- Do not access or modify other users’ data.
- Avoid service degradation; rate-limit your tests.
- No ransom, extortion, or public pressure tactics.

## 5. Our Commitment
- Initial acknowledgement within **72 hours**.
- Transparent status updates and prioritised remediation.
- Optional researcher credit after fix (with your consent).

## 6. Safe Harbor
Good-faith research within this policy will not be pursued legally by Pichonia.

## 7. Out of Scope
- Social engineering, physical attacks, or DDoS.
- Theoretical issues without realistic exploitability.
- UI/UX bugs without security impact.
