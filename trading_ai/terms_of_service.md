## 1. Accounts & Eligibility
You must be 18+ and legally able to contract. Keep your account information accurate and secure.

## 2. Nature of Service (Educational Only)
The platform provides **tools, analytics, and educational content**. It **does not** provide financial, investment, tax, or legal advice and is **not** a broker-dealer or investment adviser. You are solely responsible for any decisions you make. Past performance does not guarantee future results.

## 3. Acceptable Use
Do not abuse, circumvent security, reverse engineer, overload systems, or violate applicable laws/market rules. We may suspend/terminate for violations or risk.

## 4. Subscriptions & Billing
Subscriptions renew **monthly** by default unless canceled prior to renewal. Unless otherwise stated, fees are **non-refundable** once a billing period begins. You may cancel anytime; access continues through the end of the paid period. Chargebacks or payment disputes may result in suspension until resolved.

> **Optional (enable if desired):** First-time subscribers may request a refund within **72 hours** of initial purchase if usage is minimal (≤ 2 strategy runs). Pichonia may verify usage.

## 5. Data & API Integrations
If you connect a broker or data provider, you authorize us to access the minimal scope needed. Tokens are stored encrypted; you can revoke them anytime. We do **not** store raw credentials.

## 6. Intellectual Property
The platform, software, and content are owned by Pichonia LLC. You receive a limited, revocable license to use the service per these Terms.

## 7. Disclaimers & Limitation of Liability
Service is provided **“as is”** and **“as available.”** To the fullest extent permitted by law, we disclaim warranties and limit liability. Our aggregate liability will not exceed the greater of **$100** or the amounts paid to us in the **12 months** preceding the claim.

## 8. Termination
We may suspend or terminate for violations or risk. You may stop using the service at any time; certain obligations (fees owed, disputes) survive termination.

## 9. Governing Law & Dispute Resolution
These Terms are governed by **Delaware** law. Disputes are resolved by **binding arbitration** under the **AAA Consumer Arbitration Rules** (or **Commercial Rules** for business accounts), seat/venue **Delaware**, with hearings permitted by video conference. Small-claims actions may proceed in a court of competent jurisdiction. **Class-action and jury-trial waivers** apply. **Fees:** AAA rules govern; each party bears its own attorneys’ fees unless the award provides otherwise as permitted by law.

## 10. Changes
We may update these Terms; continued use after changes become effective constitutes acceptance.
